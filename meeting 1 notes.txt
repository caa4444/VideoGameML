Initial approach (We can do the first 2 as soon as we get all the prices and import it):

method 1: use the price of every time as features
method 2: use the historical price as features
method 3: use the historical prices of what we think is relevant
	a: by category
	b: by price correlations
	c: using wiki link data


to do for next time:
	make and run price scraping script
	parse out additional info from the wiki

potential considerations:
	GE updates are capped, so sudden price jumps may be shown as an increasing trend over months when it actually isn't
